          >Dole plc is the world’s leading fresh produce company. We’ve brought
          together the expertise, experience and resources of Dole Food Company
          and Total Produce – two organizations with more than 300 years of
          combined history to create something special.</strong

      <p>
        Both Dole Food Company and Total Produce can point to a rich history and
        heritage within the fresh produce industry – both companies origins date
        back to the 1850s. From beginnings as local fruit and vegetable growers
        and wholesalers to global market leaders, ours is a story of two
        culturally organizations coming together, united by a commitment to
        quality and an ambition to create a new compelling force in fresh
        produce.
      </p>
      <p>A Milestone Moment</p>
      <p>
        Coming as it does at a moment of great opportunity for the fresh produce
        industry, given the confluence of health and sustainability megatrends
        aligning behind the sector, the creation of Dole plc, and the coming
        together of Total Produce and Dole Food Company, represents an important
        moment in the evolution of both businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dole plc has the managerial track record, the field to fork
        infrastructure, the resources, the people, the expertise and the
        on-the-ground marketplace presence to harness the inherent potential
        evident across the fresh produce sector. The opportunity apparent is to
        raise the bar in fresh produce provision- to simultaneously drive our
        business forward, to make the world a healthier, more sustainable place
        and to add another chapter to our collective story.
